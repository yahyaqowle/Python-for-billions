### Output Variables


#The Python print() function is often used to output variables.
x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)

#In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:
x = "c++"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)

#Notice the space character after "Python " and "is ", without them the result would be "Pythonisawesome".
x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z) #You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:

#example
x = "Machine learning "
y = "will "
z = "be awesome"
print(x + y + z) #You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:

# In the print() function, when you try to combine a string and a number with the + operator, Python will give you an error: here is example
x = 5
y = "Bulbeni"
#print(x + y) # this is an error

#The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas, which even support different data types:
x = 5
y = "Bulbeni"
print(x, y)
